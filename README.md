## TODO list:

- Computer paddle movement
- Fix ~~bugs~~ undocumented features
- ???
- Profit

## Notes:

- Yes, it's all in one file, sue me. My original goal was to only add that one .fs file to GitHub, so that's that.
- This is one of my first ever projects with F#. I am _not_ aware of best code practices or shortcuts I could've used. Feedback is always appreciated.
